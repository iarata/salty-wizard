# Uncovering Structure in Speech-Evoked Neural Signals

This repository contains the code to make the report for Computational Tools for Data Science course

Data has to be obtained from kaggle in https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/brain-to-text-25/data?select=t15_copyTask_neuralData

## Clustering

For the clustering section all notebooks and code are in the "clustering" folder. Notebooks produce the figures and data for analysis.

## Evaluating

Python file for TF-IDF calculating is also found in "clustering" folder. Can be run by itself with the command

- python clustering/cluster_eval.py

## Embeddings

TBD
