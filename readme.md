# Uncovering Structure in Speech-Evoked Neural Signals

This repository contains the code to make the report for Computational Tools for Data Science course

Data has to be obtained from kaggle in https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/brain-to-text-25/data?select=t15_copyTask_neuralData

## Data analysis

Data exploration notedook, used for the Data Analysis section in the report found in folder analisis/

## Clustering

For the clustering section all notebooks and code are in the "clustering" folder. Notebooks produce the figures and data for analysis.

TF-IDF notebook can also be accessed in the "clustering" folder

## Embeddings

TBD
